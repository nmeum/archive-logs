.Nm archive-logs
.Nd archive newline separated log files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm archive-logs
.Op Fl p Ar percentage
.Ar current
.Ar archive
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility copies newline separated log data from a
.Ar current
logging directory to an
.Ar archive
directory.
The utility iterates over all regular files in the current directory.
A configurable percentage of lines is retained in the iterated files.
The remaining lines are appended to equally named files in the archive and
erased from the files in the current directory.
This property allows iteratively invoking the utility on the same pair
of directories.
.Pp
The utility operates under two central assumptions.
First, it is assumed that no other program access any files in the given
directories while
.Nm
is running.
Second, the utility assumes that log files are appended.
Based on the later assumption only older log file entries are copied to
the archive while more recent entries are retained.
